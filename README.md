# Stat_Tests
So, I've studied a full semester of Experimental Design with an excellent professor from Cuba, which means his teaching methodology consists of thirty straight minutes of writing the theory for each ANOVA method by hand, and doing the maths of each problem the same way. Although I've never had to do it again by hand since we learned how to use SPSS right on the next semester I still remember how my hand and butt used to hurt for the entire weekends of writing full data sets and analysing them. Anyway, I decided to learn R for creating markdown files the moment Overleaf couldn't process my Research thesis images due to the size of my files, and after I was done with it I figured I might as well learn how to run statistical analysis with it. 

So here we are.
